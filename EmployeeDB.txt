SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE birth_date BETWEEN '1952-01-01' AND '1955-12-31';

The SELECT statement is more specific this time. Instead of an asterisk to indicate that we want all of the records, we're requesting only the first and last names of the employees.
FROM employees tells SQL in which of the six tables to look.
The WHERE clause brings up even more specifics. We want SQL to look in the birth_date column for anyone born between January 1, 1952, and December 31, 1955.
Notice how BETWEEN and AND are both capitalized in our statement? This is part of the SQL syntax. It not only signals the conditions present, but also makes the code easier to read.
